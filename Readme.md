Incident Geometry Readme
========================

The Incident Geometry package presents a formalization of incident
geometry. Incident geometry is a simplified model of geometry in
which there are only three types of entities: space, lines, and
points; and two relations "lies on" and "parallel." Surprisingly,
incident geometry has a rich mathematical structure and in this
package we present a number of proofs of some basic theorems.

In addition to providing an axiomatic definition for incident
geometry, this package includes numerous functions and theorems for
manipulating lists and simple sets. All told, this package includes
over 70 definitions and proofs.

Structure
---------

Currently, all of the definitions and theorems are defined in a
single file, incidence.v. This file defines the Incidence module,
which defines the Incidence structure and its associated theorems.

Compiling
---------

To compile this package, simply run `make`.
